# Daily Progress Log

## April 28, 2025

- **Problems solved:**
  - [Longest Common Prefix] - [Easy]
    - Approach: [Compare all words in array with base prefix. Change base prefix until true one is found ]
    - Time complexity: O(m * n) # m is length of the array, n is the length of the shortest word
    - Space complexity: O(1)
    - Key insights: [Use first word as base prefix and loop over the rest of the words]
    - Revision count: 1 (First attempt)

  - [Group Anagram] - [Easy]
    - Approach: [For every word in the array, create a tuple key with array of words matching number of letters in the key as value in hashmap]
    - Time complexity: O(m * n) m is number of strings (words) and n is the length of the longest word
    - Space complexity: O(m) # Use hashmap
    - Key insights: [Find the difference between target number and number ]
    - Revision count: 1 (First attempt)

- **Challenges:**
  - None

- **Plan for tomorrow:**
  - Continue with other questions

- **Note**
  - Finished it some days back but not saved.


## April 21, 2025

- **Problems solved:**
  - [Two Sum] - [Easy]
    - Approach: [Use hashmaps to the keep track of the number passed through in the array]
    - Time complexity: O(n) # Go through the list once
    - Space complexity: O(n) # Use hashmap
    - Key insights: [Find the difference between target number and number ]
    - Revision count: 1 (First attempt)

- **Challenges:**
  - Having a hard time wrapping my head on how Longest Common Prefix solution works.

- **Plan for tomorrow:**
  - Tackle Longest Common Prefix problem again.
