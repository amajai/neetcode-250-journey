3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/neetcode-250-journey.git`

### Sharing Your Solutions

If you'd like to contribute your own solution to a problem:

1. Create a directory with your GitHub username in the `community_solutions` folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p community_solutions/amajai/problem_name

2. Add your solution file(s) to this directory
cp your-solution.py community_solutions/amajai/problem_name/

3. Include a brief explanation of your approach in a comment or separate markdown file

4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contribution

### Solution Formatting

When contributing a solution, please follow these guidelines:

- Include the problem name and number in a comment at the top
- Specify the time and space complexity
- Add brief comments explaining your approach
- Include example test cases if possible

Example:
```python
"""
Problem: Two Sum (#1)
Difficulty: Easy

Approach: 
Used a hash map to store values and their indices, checking if the complement
exists as we iterate through the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
"""

def twoSum(nums, target):
 seen = {}
 for i, num in enumerate(nums):
     complement = target - num
     if complement in seen:
         return [seen[complement], i]
     seen[num] = i
 return []
```

## Alternative Solution Approaches

If you have an alternative approach to a problem already solved in the main solutions:

- Add your solution to `community_solutions/YOUR-USERNAME/problem_name/`
- Include comments explaining how your approach differs and any trade-offs


## Improving Documentation

Contributions to improve documentation, fix typos, or enhance explanations are also welcome!
